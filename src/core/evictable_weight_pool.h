// remapped into a reserved overlay range, so a transaction hands out device memory without a single
// allocation and captured graphs stay valid because the home mapping never moves. Closing the

// evict() quiesces both streams of the owning DeviceContext before remapping. The caller
// guarantees that no other stream touches the arena while a transaction is open.
