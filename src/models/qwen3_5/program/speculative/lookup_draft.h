// Context-lookup drafting: propose the continuation that followed the last time this n-gram
// appeared.
//
// A draft model guesses what comes next from weights; this guesses it from the text already in
// front of it, which costs no device work at all. It is worthless on free-form prose and close to
// perfect wherever the output repeats the input -- summarising, editing, answering from a retrieved
// passage, or emitting code that reuses names and structure already on screen. Those are the cases
// a draft head is weakest on, which is why the two are complements rather than alternatives.
//
// It is exact. The proposal is one-hot, the verify step accepts the longest correct prefix and
// commits the target model's own argmax at the first mismatch, so a wrong guess costs throughput
// and never changes a token.
//
// MEASURED, 2026-09-19, Qwen3.8-27B on one 3090, `-pg 4096,256`, MTP with the optimised draft head,
// lookup preferred over the head's proposal whenever it matches:
//
//   n-gram    2      3      4      6      8     16     off
//   decode  135.6  148.9  143.5  145.2  148.7  148.5  144.9 tok/s
//   accept   0.87   1.00   0.96   0.97   1.00   1.00   0.964
//
// **Short n-grams lose.** At 2 the proposal is worse than the draft head's and decode drops 7%: a
// two-token context matches all over the place and the continuations disagree. From 8 up every
// match that fires is correct -- acceptance is exactly 1.0 -- and decode gains ~3%.
//
// **The gain is small because there was little to win.** The draft head already accepts 95-96% on
// this model, so a perfect drafter is worth +5.5% at K=3 and +13% at K=5 and no more; this takes
// about half of that (K=5: 182.7 -> 191.0 tok/s). Anyone expecting the large numbers reported for
// lookup drafting elsewhere should check the baseline's acceptance first -- against a weak drafter
// the same technique is transformative, and against this one it is a trim.
//
// **Where the real headroom is:** at 100% acceptance tokens per round is set by the draft window,
// and MTP caps it at kMtpDecodeMaximumDrafts = 5. Measured at that ceiling: K=3/4/5 give
// 148.9/169.3/191.0 tok/s. A lookup drafter has no architectural limit on how far ahead it can
// propose, so a lookup-only backend sized like DFlash's (K up to 15) is the version worth building.
//
// Returns the number of drafts written, and zero when the n-gram has not been seen before -- which
// the round already treats as a plain decode step.
