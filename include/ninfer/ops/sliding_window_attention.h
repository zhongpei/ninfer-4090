/**
 * Symmetric non-causal sliding-window grouped-query attention.
 *
 * The registered profiles are D=128, Hq=32, Hkv=8 (group 4), window/cyclic capacity 2048 or
 * 4096, scale=1/sqrt(128), T=1..16, and B=1..8. q/out are contiguous BF16 [128,32,T,B],
 * query_k/query_v are contiguous BF16 [128,8,T,B], positions is contiguous device I32 [T,B], and
 * valid_columns and lanes are contiguous device I32 [B]. Row b has V=valid_columns[b] live query
 * columns, positions[i,b]=L+i for i<V, and lanes[b] selects its cyclic-cache lane. Columns i>=V
 * are an inert physical tail and produce exact BF16 zero.
 *
 * The read-only cyclic BFloat16 context stores BF16 K and V for committed absolute positions
 * [max(0,L-window),L), with absolute position p stored at slot p mod window. Temporary query K/V is
 * a separate BF16 segment at [L,L+V). For live query position p_i, a populated context or
 * temporary key at p_j is visible
 * exactly when abs(p_j-p_i)<window. Thus distance window-1 is included and distance window is
 * excluded; every live query also sees every live temporary query row in its batch row. Query
 * head h reads KV head floor(h/4).
 *
 * The independent oracle evaluates the complete formula naively in FP64 from represented BF16
 * query/context K and BF16 query V / BF16 cached V, using a stable Softmax over exactly that
 * visible set. BF16 out is promoted for comparison; storage rounding belongs to the Op criterion.
 * q/query_k/query_v/positions/valid_columns/lanes, every cyclic-cache byte, out, and live workspace
 * allocations are pairwise non-overlapping. Inputs and context remain unchanged; out is the only
 * observable mutation and is completely overwritten.
 *
 * The caller guarantees envelope.min_context <= L <= envelope.max_context, sequential nonnegative
 * live positions, and that the selected lane contains the declared committed interval. The
 * envelope is a host launch/workspace resource promise; it never changes the admitted key set or
 * numerical result.
