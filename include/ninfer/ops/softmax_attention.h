/**
 * Shared numerical contract.
 *
 * Every entry computes stable scaled dot-product Softmax Attention. Query head h reads KV head
 * floor(h / (Hq/Hkv)). Public BF16 inputs and persistent cache rows are interpreted after their
 * storage boundary. In the BFloat16 cache profile, K and V are both stored as BF16.
 * For a declared visible key set J, the independent mathematical oracle is
 *
 *   score[j]       = scale * dot(FP64(q[:,h,i]), FP64(k[:,kvh,j]))
 *   probability[j] = exp(score[j] - max(score)) / sum_x exp(score[x] - max(score))
 *   ideal[:,h,i]   = sum_j probability[j] * FP64(v[:,kvh,j]).
 *
 * Dot products, stable Softmax, and the value reduction are evaluated naively in FP64. The BF16
 * Op output is promoted to FP64 for comparison; storage rounding belongs to the Op criterion and
 * is not reproduced by the oracle.
 *
 * A causal INT8-G64 V row is interpreted by decoding each signed code c with its stored FP16 scale
 * bits: FP32(c) * FP32(scale_bits). A causal rk8v4 (packed INT4) V row stores two signed 4-bit
 * codes per byte - the even dimension d in the low nibble, the odd dimension d+1 in the high
 * nibble - plus one stored FP16 scale per 32-value group, and each code c is decoded as
 * FP32(c) * FP32(scale_bits). A causal FP8-E4M3FN V row has one stored FP16 scale for D256;
 * each finite code e is decoded as FP32(e) * FP32(scale_bits). Quantized K uses the paired physical
 * representation written by kv_cache_append; its original-coordinate logical row is consumed
 * through the matching private Q/K profile. The fixed orthogonal preparation and transient Q
 * quantization are implementation details, not intermediate values in the ideal oracle above.
 *
 * NVFP4 and K8V4 profiles store R*V for the normalized Hadamard R=H256/16 and apply R^T after the
 * complete attention reduction (both K and, for these two profiles, V are stored pre-rotated; a
 * plain FP8 V plane is not rotated, so its reduction has no inverse-rotation step).
 *
 * The qualified BFloat16 compute profile keeps Q/K and persistent K at BF16 and uses native BF16
 * QK plus FP16 P/V MMA. INT8-G64 uses native signed-INT8 Q/K MMA; its prompt route uses FP16 P/V
 * MMA and its small-T route uses BF16 P/V MMA. sm_100a/sm_120a use native E4M3FN QK MMA for FP8
 * and K8V4's key plane; this fork's sm_86/sm_89 build has no FP8 tensor-core path at all (unlike
 * INT8), so FP8, K8V4, and NVFP4 instead dequantize both K and V to BF16/FP16 up front and run QK
 * on native BF16 MMA, exactly as the BFloat16 profile does. NVFP4 and K8V4 never quantize Q to
 * FP4 or FP8 on any target. INT8 QK accumulates each group in INT32 and combines represented group
 * products in FP32; the other QK profiles accumulate in FP32. Every profile retains FP32
 * accumulation for PV, split state, merge, normalization, and applicable Hadamard reductions. P is
 * never quantized to FP8/FP4, and only the final public output is stored as BF16. These arithmetic
 * paths are implementation profiles rather than extra public tensor boundaries. Every cache route
 * has one named numerical criterion and is checked directly against its independent oracle;
 * route-to-route parity is only supplementary evidence.
 * Newly appended rows cross their specified persistent codec boundary before attention
 * observes them.
 * Those criteria apply to the registered geometries, tested extents, conformance matrix, and
 * target-representative activation range; they are not universal error bounds for arbitrary
 * adversarial BF16 tensors.
