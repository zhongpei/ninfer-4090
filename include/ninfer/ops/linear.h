/**
 * @brief Applies a bias-free matrix projection independently to every input column.
 *
 * @details The ideal mathematical result is
 *
 * @f[
 *   \mathrm{ideal}_{n,t} =
 *   \sum_{k=0}^{K-1}
 *     \mathrm{FP32Dequant}(w)_{n,k}\,\mathrm{FP32}(x_{k,t}).
 * @f]
 *
 * `out` stores a BF16 approximation of this ideal result under the named numerical criterion for
 * the selected private activation-compute path.
 *
 * @par Logical tensors and layout
 * `x` is contiguous, non-null, 16-byte-aligned BF16 `[K,T]`, `w` has logical shape `[N,K]`, and
 * `out` is contiguous, non-null, 16-byte-aligned BF16 `[N,T]`. Every logical extent is positive;
 * in particular, `T=0` is invalid rather than a no-op. Dimension zero is stored fastest. The Op has
 * no bias, activation, residual addition, or transpose mode.
 *
 * @par Supported execution domain
 * Registered execution uses RowSplit Q4_G64_FP16, Q5_G64_FP16, Q6_G64_FP16, or Q8_G32_FP16 weights
 * with FP16 scales, block-scaled NVFP4 weights, row-scaled FP8_E4M3FN_ROW_BF16 weights, plus
 * registered contiguous BF16 problems. Each format owns a finite registry of exact physical
 * weight problems and selects its kernel internally; a valid encoding and alignment do not imply
 * arbitrary N/K support. FP8 currently registers `[N,K]` in `{[14336,5120], [16384,5120],
 * [34816,5120], [248320,5120], [5120,6144], [5120,17408]}` at every positive T. The current NVFP4
 * problems register the five non-vocabulary FP8 geometries and accept every positive T. Q8 also
 * registers `[5120,25600]` at every positive T. BF16 registers `[14336,5120]`,
 * `[5120,6144]`, and `[256,5120]` at every positive T. Text and MTP packed-weight problems accept
 * every positive column extent T. Registered Vision problems accept raw-patch P in
 * `{4,8,...,131072}` or merged-token V in `[1,32768]`; a matrix column does not inherently
 * represent a text token. FP32 is unsupported.
 *
 * @par Numerical contract
 * Test fixture code materializes the persistent weight as its logical FP32 dequantized matrix.
 * The one Linear oracle accepts that matrix and the FP32 values represented by the BF16 activation,
 * evaluates every complete dot product with naive FP64 accumulation, and retains the FP64 result.
 * The BF16 output is promoted and compared against that result. Output representation,
 * accumulator precision, activation quantization, staging, reduction order, and kernel schedule
 * are private implementation effects covered by the named tolerance for the selected
 * activation-compute path; none is copied into the oracle. Kernel, schedule, template instance,
 * host launcher, and T region do not create separate criteria inside one path.
 *
 * @par Compute policy
 * `policy` specifies the permitted private activation-compute set. A permission does not require a
 * corresponding low-precision route: the resolved plan may remain A16 when that is the qualified
 * choice. Every policy permits the existing A16 implementations of BF16 and Q4/Q5/Q6/Q8.
 * FP8 accepts all three policies; AllowA8 and AllowA4 permit its A8 routes. Both resolve
 * `[14336,5120]` to A16 through T=11 and A8 from T=12; `[16384,5120]` to A16 through T=10 and A8
 * from T=11; `[34816,5120]` to A8 at T=1, A16 at T=2..4, and A8 from T=5; both `[5120,6144]` and
 * `[5120,17408]` resolve T<25 to A16 and T>=25 to A8. FP8 `[248320,5120]` admits A16Only, AllowA8,
 * and AllowA4; every policy retains A16 compute at every positive T. NVFP4 uses A16 for A16Only and
 * AllowA8; AllowA4 permits the private resolver to select either a qualified A16 route or
 * activation quantization to NVFP4 at every positive T. The selected route depends only on the
 * registered problem and T.
 *
 * @par Workspace
 * `workspace` is caller-owned call-scoped transient storage sized by
 * linear_workspace_capacity_bytes(). It must not overlap x, any weight plane, or out. Linear does
 * not allocate device memory internally.
 *
 * @param[in] x Contiguous, non-null, 16-byte-aligned BF16 input matrix `[K,T]`.
 * @param[in] w Logical weight matrix `[N,K]` in a registered persistent format and layout.
 * @param[out] out Contiguous, non-null, 16-byte-aligned BF16 output matrix `[N,T]`. It must not
 * overlap `x` or any weight plane.
 * @param[in] policy Permitted private activation-compute profiles.
 * @param[in,out] workspace Caller-owned transient arena.
 * @param[in] stream CUDA stream on which execution is enqueued.
