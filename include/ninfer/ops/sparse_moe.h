/**
 * Closed sparse-MoE Op for the exact future 35B-A3B geometry.
 *
 * For contiguous BF16 x [2048,T] and destination [2048,T] with T>0, 256 routed experts, top-8
 * selection, and one always-on shared expert, this Op owns router projection and selection,
 * selected routed and shared SwiGLU projections, down projections, their merge, and the
 * AddResidual epilogue independently for every token column. At an exact top-8 boundary tie the
 * lower expert id wins. destination is the only observable mutation: its incoming value is the
 * residual and its outgoing value is the BF16 sparse-MoE result plus that residual.
 *
 * The complete mathematical oracle starts from represented BF16 inputs, exact stored-weight
 * decode, and evaluates the logical formula naively in FP32/FP64. Scores, route weights, expert
 * activations, workspace representation, reduction association, and scale placement are private
 * execution choices rather than semantic rounding boundaries.
 *
 * The five weights have the exact registered shapes: BF16 router/shared gate [257,2048], routed
 * gate/up [256*1024,2048], routed down [256*2048,512], shared gate/up [1024,2048], and shared down
 * [2048,512]. Admitted codec profiles are Q4+Q5, Q4+Q6, and Q8+Q8 for the two routed banks; both
 * shared banks are Q8. Expert e directly selects its stored row spans; no selected-weight gather
 * or repack occurs.
 *
 * Every positive T is supported.
 *
 * x, destination, all weight planes, and live workspace must be pairwise non-overlapping.
 * Execution is enqueued on stream without host synchronization. Workspace is caller-owned,
 * graph-stable transient storage and carries no state beyond the call.
