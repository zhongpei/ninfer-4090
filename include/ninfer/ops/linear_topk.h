 * `[16,U]`. Rank is stored fastest; a caller may view the output as `[16,K,B]` when `U=K*B`.
 * Candidates are ordered by descending computed score, with exact score ties resolved by lower
 * global token id. Physical rows `[valid_rows,248320)` never participate. Projection uses the
 * registered A16 arithmetic profile; candidate scores are returned directly in FP32 and no dense
 * vocabulary-logit tensor is an observable intermediate.
 *
 * All tensors and every weight plane are preserved except that both output tensors are completely
 * overwritten. Inputs, outputs, weight planes, and workspace must not overlap. The Op has no
 * persistent state and performs no internal device allocation.
