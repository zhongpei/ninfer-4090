/**
 * Produces one token id per independent request row. `logits` is contiguous BF16
 * [physical_rows,B], `out` and `logical_positions` are contiguous I32 [B], and only vocabulary
 * rows v in [0,token_domain) participate. `configs` is a device-resident contiguous
 * SamplingConfig[B] array. Greedy and stochastic rows may coexist in one invocation.
 *
 * For row b with configs[b].temperature<=0:
 *
 * With either greedy or positive-temperature sampling, let
 * c_v=configs[b].token_counts[v] (or zero when the pointer is null):
 *
 *   adjusted_v = float(logits[v,b])
 *                - configs[b].presence_penalty * (c_v > 0)
 *                - configs[b].frequency_penalty * c_v.
 *
 * A greedy row selects min argmax_v adjusted_v and skips filters and RNG. Candidates for a
 * positive-temperature row are sorted by adjusted_v descending with lower token id breaking
 * ties. Per-row top_k
 * in [1,19] keeps that many candidates; top_k<=0 or top_k>=20 keeps min(20,token_domain).
 * Candidate weights are exp(adjusted_v/temperature-max). min_p removes the suffix below
 * min_p*max_weight; top_p keeps the shortest remaining prefix whose cumulative weight reaches
 * top_p times the pre-truncation candidate weight. At least the best candidate remains, the
 * support is renormalized, and one id is drawn for that row.
 *
 * Row b uses counter-based RNG key
 * (configs[b].seed,logical_positions[b],purpose), without mutable RNG state or dependence on the
 * compact row index. In every mode the selected token atomically increments
 * configs[b].token_counts when it is non-null. Non-null token-count arrays belonging to distinct
 * active requests must not alias. `out` must not overlap logits, configs, logical_positions, or any
 * token-count array. The Op writes all of out, uses caller-owned transient storage reported by
 * sampling_workspace_capacity_bytes(), and has no other persistent-state side effect.
