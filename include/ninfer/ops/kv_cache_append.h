/**
 * Append every K/V row to single-sequence paged growing-cache storage.
 *
 * k/v are contiguous BF16 [256,4|2,T] and positions is contiguous sequential device I32 [T].
 * BF16 cache mode copies K and V bit-for-bit; both planes are BF16. INT8-G64 cache rows
 * use one scale for each contiguous 64-value group. For codec input values x, the persistent
 * INT8 group encoding is
 *
 *   a          = max_i abs(FP32(x[i]))
 *   scale_bits = FP16_RNE(a / 127)
 *   s          = FP32(scale_bits)
 *   inv        = s == 0 ? 0 : FP32(1 / s)
 *   code[i]    = s == 0 ? 0 : I8(clamp(RNE_even(FP32(x[i]) * inv), -127, 127))
 *   decode[i]  = FP32(code[i]) * s.
 *
 * FP8_E4M3FN cache rows use one FP16 scale for the complete D256 row:
 *
 *   a          = max_i abs(FP32(x[i]))
 *   a == 0: scale_bits=FP16(+0), code[i]=E4M3FN(+0)
 *   a != 0: raw_scale  = a / 448
 *           scale_bits = FP16_RNE(clamp(raw_scale, 0x1p-24, 65504))
 *           s          = FP32(scale_bits)
 *           inv        = FP32(1 / s)
 *           code[i]    = E4M3FN_RNE_SATFINITE(FP32(x[i]) * inv)
 *   decode[i] = FP32(E4M3FN(code[i])) * s.
 *
 * A cache whose value plane is DType::U8 selects the rk8v4 profile: keys keep the INT8-G64
 * encoding above and values are stored as signed 4-bit codes, two per byte, in a value plane of
 * half the head dimension. Dimension d occupies the low nibble of byte d/2 when d is even and the
 * high nibble when d is odd. Values use a 32-value group rather than the key plane's 64, so their
 * scale plane has twice the key plane's leading extent: four bits resolve a group to 15 levels, so
 * one outlier would otherwise set the step for 64 neighbours. The group encoding is the INT8 one
 * with 7 in place of 127, over that 32-value group:
 *
 *   a          = max_i abs(FP32(x[i]))
 *   scale_bits = FP16_RNE(a / 7)
 *   s          = FP32(scale_bits)
 *   inv        = s == 0 ? 0 : FP32(1 / s)
 *   code[i]    = s == 0 ? 0 : I4(clamp(RNE_even(FP32(x[i]) * inv), -7, 7))
 *   decode[i]  = FP32(code[i]) * s.
 *
 * V uses represented BF16 source values directly as x under every profile, including rk8v4: values
 * are never rotated, so no inverse preparation is applied to the attention output. For every
 * quantized profile, K is a paired physical representation for causal Attention: its
 * implementation-owned fixed orthogonal preparation selects x, and the causal consumer applies the
 * matching private Q preparation. The transform and raw K code/scale bytes are not standalone
 * mathematical outputs. Standalone and
 * fused append produce the same consumable K representation. Every addressed code/value and scale
 * is overwritten, and no unrelated cache row is read or written. Inputs and every cache
 * plane/table are pairwise non-overlapping. The Op owns no persistent allocation, frontier,
 * request identity, or commit authority.
 *
 * NVFP4-G16 and K8V4 KV-cache profiles are also ported on this fork: both planes use the e2m1
 * codec (Nvfp4Group16) or an FP8 key paired with an e2m1 value plane (Fp8KeyNvfp4Value), each with
 * a raw E4M3-byte group-16 scale on their e2m1 plane(s). See d256_kv_cache_profile's KvCacheStorage
 * overload for the exact per-plane encoding.
