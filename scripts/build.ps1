# Build NInfer-3090 on Windows with the toolchain this project actually needs.
#
# Three things are not the defaults on a typical machine, and getting any of them wrong produces
# an error that does not name the real cause:
#
#   MSVC 14.4x from VS 2022 BuildTools. VS 2026 ships MSVC 14.50 (_MSC_VER 1950), which CUDA
#   12.8's host_config.h rejects outright - it accepts 1910-1949. If a VS 2026 cl.exe wins on
#   PATH you get a wall of host_config errors that say nothing about the compiler version.
#
#   CUDA 12.8, forced through CUDACXX. If an older toolkit is also installed it is picked up from
#   PATH instead and the configure step fails the CMakeLists version guard.
#
#   The Ninja generator. MSBuild's CUDA integration needs CUDA_PATH_V12_8, which the CUDA
#   installer does not always set; without it CudaToolkitDir resolves empty and every .cu fails.
#
# Running this from a plain PowerShell prompt is fine: it imports the BuildTools environment
# itself rather than requiring a Developer Prompt.
