rem   qwen38-27b       Qwen3.8-27B, 19.0 GiB. The default 27B for every benchmark in this repository
rem                    and the one docs\config-calculator.html's "27b" rows are measured against. It
rem                    is the official v3 artifact with the DFlash2 bundle, and it carries the MTP
rem                    weights too, so one file serves both --spec mtp and --spec dflash2. Published
rem                    measurements were taken against the v2 pin 18dfc887, whose weight bytes the v3
rem                    container preserves.
rem   qwen36-27b       Qwen3.6-27B groupwise-int, 16.3 GiB, target_key qwen3_6_27b. A different model
rem                    family from qwen3_8_27b, which is why having the latter does not satisfy the
rem                    former: four real-model tests -- ninfer_qwen3_6_27b_prefix_real_test,
rem                    _score_real_test, _load_plan_test and the Qwen3.6 27B half of the engine suite
rem                    -- skip without it.
rem   qwen36-35b-a3b   Qwen3.6-35B-A3B, 21.2 GiB, the RTX 3090-compatible vision model. The official
rem                    v3 artifact revision: its artifact-manifest.json lists the text, vision, mtp
rem                    and dflash components, and the DFlash bundle (from
rem                    z-lab/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-DFlash) is what --spec dflash needs.
rem
rem To repin a model, edit its block below: take the size and sha256 from what HuggingFace reports for
rem the new revision (X-Linked-Size and X-Linked-ETag on the resolve URL, or the revision's
rem artifact-manifest.json), and for qwen36-35b-a3b check the manifest still lists a dflash component.
rem Changing a pin makes the staging hazard below live rather than hypothetical.
