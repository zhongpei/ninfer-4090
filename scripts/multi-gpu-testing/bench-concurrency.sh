#   1. How much context can we actually hold at a given concurrency, in each mode?
#   2. Under that load, does it still generate at a usable rate, or did the crossings cripple it?
#
# Aggregate tok/s under concurrent load is the number that matters -- single-stream decode is the
# worst case for an offload design, because the per-forward-pass crossing cost is paid by one
# token instead of being shared across a batch.
