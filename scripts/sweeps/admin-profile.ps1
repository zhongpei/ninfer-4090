# Everything in this repository that needs an elevated shell, in one run.
#
# THIS MUST BE RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR. Open Windows Terminal or PowerShell with "Run as
# administrator" and run it from the repository root:
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\sweeps\admin-profile.ps1
#
# It needs admin for exactly two reasons, both verified on this box on 2026-09-09:
#
#   * ncu fails with ERR_NVGPUCTRPERM as a normal user. GPU performance counters are
#     administrator-only by default on Windows. That permission is satisfied by EITHER running
#     elevated OR setting HKLM\...\NvTweak\RmProfilingAdminOnly = 0 and rebooting. Running
#     elevated is strictly better: nothing persists, and no reboot.
#   * nvidia-smi -pl and -lgc are refused with "Insufficient Permissions" as a normal user.
#
# It changes two pieces of GPU state -- the power limit and the clock lock -- and restores both in
# a finally block, including on Ctrl+C. Nothing it does survives the script.
#
# Two things will make it fail on this box, both hit on 2026-09-09 and both guarded below.
#
#   * ncu's default kernel replay saves and restores the device memory a kernel could touch, and
#     with 21 GB of weights resident there is no room on the card, so it spills the backup to host
#     RAM. On top of the artifact's own host footprint that is ~42 GB, which does not fit beside
#     vmmemWSL. The failure is "==WARNING== Backing up device memory in system memory" followed by
#     "Unhandled C++ exception: bad allocation" and an empty report -- which reads like an ncu bug
#     and is not one. --replay-mode application re-runs the application once per pass instead and
#     needs no backup at all; it is slower (a full model load per pass) and it is the only mode
#     that works here on the 35B. See $ReplayMode below.
#   * host memory pressure. Guarded by host-memory.ps1, with the requirement raised because an ncu
#     run holds more than a plain bench run does.
#
# Results land under profiles\admin\ as text files. Nothing here needs interpreting live; the
# point is to capture what an unelevated session cannot.

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------- 5. narrow-extent weight streaming
  #
  # The largest un-attributed gap in TODO, and the one two separate entries converge on. §2c's
  # eight-lane entry has q5_linear_add's mma_r64_c16 sitting at 24% of what its weight costs to
  # stream once, flat from T=4 to T=16; §2c's DFlash2-cliff entry has the GDN input projection's
  # grouped tile at 27% of its own weight-streaming floor at any width. Both entries independently
  # conclude the same thing: the remaining 3.7-4x is NOT tile geometry. Narrowing the tile was built
  # twice -- an R64C8 for q5_linear_add, which lost 6-32%, and the GDN C8/C16 tiles, which won 11%
  # and left the floor exactly where it was. So the mechanism is something else, and nothing in the
  # file has counters on it.
  #
  # This profiles the SCHEDULE BENCHES rather than the product, which is the whole reason it is
  # cheap: they allocate their own weights and never load an artifact, so there is no 22.8 GB model
  # load per replay pass and kernel replay would work here even if the card were full. Every
  # schedule of the Op runs in one process at one width, so the fast and slow tiles are profiled
  # under identical conditions in the same run -- which is the comparison that matters.
  #
  # WarpStateStats is the section to read first. "Weight-read-bound at a quarter of bandwidth" has a
  # small number of possible signatures and they are distinguishable: stall_long_scoreboard
  # dominating means the loads are issued but not enough of them are in flight; stall_mio_throttle
  # means the LSU itself is the limit; a poor sectors-per-request in the memory tables means each
  # fetch is delivering a fraction of a sector's worth of useful bytes. Those want different fixes.
