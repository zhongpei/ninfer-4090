// Which output rows the FP64 oracle covers. Every column is always compared, in both cases. An
// error that is a property of the contraction -- a dequantization that rounds, a dropped K tile, a
// wrapped scale stride -- reaches one column as readily as the next, so sampling columns bought
// nothing but a noisier reading of the same ratio and a cap of 1,024 elements however wide the
// call. It is also not the more expensive choice: the oracle depends on the token index alone, so
// it is evaluated once per shape at the widest invocation and sliced, where the thirty-two-column
// version was recomputed per invocation.

// The sign distribution of the activation. `Centered` draws from [-0.5, 0.5); `Biased` draws from
// [0.125, 0.496], every element the same sign, as a SwiGLU or a softmax output is. A centered
// activation lets a per-weight error cancel along K at the same rate as the dot product it
// perturbs; a one-sign activation does not, so it is the harsher of the two on a weight decode that
// rounds. Measured on the Q8 MMA tiles' `round_bf16(code * scale)`, the two agree within 0.02 of
// the criterion on nine of the ten Q8 shapes the shipped artifact carries, and on the tenth
// ([14336, 5120]) `Biased` reads 0.75 against `Centered`'s 0.60 -- the difference between a quarter
// of the budget in hand and two fifths.
//
// The `linear_add` suite, whose fixture is one-sign, measured 1.15 for the same rounding at
// [5120, 17408], where both of these read 0.60. So how much a decode that rounds costs is a
// property of the fixture's code-and-activation pairing and not of K alone; run the shapes that
// matter both ways rather than reasoning from one number.
