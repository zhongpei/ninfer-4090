"""Fine-tune the block drafter on the target's own distribution, offline.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The engine's speed is acceptance times step rate, and the step is at the weight format's floor. The
row this program is measured against is fresh prose and chat, where the released drafter accepts
3.28 tokens a block against 6.35 on an edit. That is not a kernel problem: it is a distribution
problem. The drafter was trained on a generic English instruction and code mixture, and it is asked
here to predict a particular 27 B model on a particular workload.

Nothing about output can change. A drafter proposes; the target verifies every token against its
own argmax and keeps the matching prefix. Training it wrong makes the engine slower and never wrong,
which is why this file has no quality gate and the losslessness gate in `tools/verify_spec.py` is
the only correctness statement needed.

THE OBJECTIVE
-------------
The drafter's forward pass is non-causal over a block of eight rows: row 0 carries the last token
the target committed, rows 1..7 are mask tokens, and row j predicts the token at anchor + j. So the
loss is over those seven rows, per block:

    L = CE(draft_logits[j], target_argmax[anchor + j])
        + w * KL(target_top64[anchor + j] || draft[j])

The hard term is the one that matches the gate exactly -- greedy verification accepts row j if and
only if its argmax equals the target's -- and the soft term is what stops the hard term from
over-fitting a single token when the target itself was nearly indifferent.

WHAT MAKES IT CHEAP
-------------------
The target never runs. `tools/record_dflash2_training_data.py` has already written its five tap tensors and its top-64
for every position, so a step reads tensors from disk and touches 1.9 B parameters, not 27 B. The
drafter's context is materialised the same way serving materialises it -- `project_context` then
`context_kv` -- and many blocks of one sequence are packed into a single pass behind a mask that
keeps them from seeing each other.

THE GATE
--------
`--eval-only`, or the evaluation that runs at every checkpoint, replays the serving loop against
held-out self-generated sequences: draft seven tokens from the anchor, count the matching prefix,
commit that many plus the target's bonus token, move the anchor, repeat. The number it reports is
the number the ledger calls accepted tokens per block, and it is exact rather than estimated,
because the target's greedy continuation of those sequences is known.

Held-out sequences are named in the data manifest and are never sampled for training.

    one job, so the cost is paid four to seven times with the GPU idle.

    The sharder repacks the same bytes into ~40 files of ~2.7 GB and writes a manifest
    that says where each sequence sits. This function then opens forty files instead of 5,863 and
    memory-maps them, so `fused` -- 99 % of the bytes, and the only field the trainer reads more
    than one sequence of -- is never copied into host RAM at all. The page cache decides what stays
    resident; a step touches ~20 MB of one sequence.

    `--keep-on cuda` is the one case that cannot be lazy: the tensors go to the GPU on the way in,
