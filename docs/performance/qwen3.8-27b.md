## Scope and run records

All runs use the [common RTX 5090 serving profile](methodology.md#common-serving-profile).
The tables below specify differences; all runs use stochastic sampling. Dates identify historical
campaign labels. Run IDs are local to this page and link to the reproduction command, artifact
path, and local report directory.

Both weight profiles cover MTP0, MTP3 C=1/2/4/8 corpus results, and DFlash2 K=7 C=1 corpus
results. DFlash2 uses artifacts with included companion weights and the terminal-settlement fix.
MTP3 G3/N3 are historical baselines using earlier artifacts. DFlash2 K=15 and concurrent DFlash2
results are not published on this page.

NS fills in the detailed evidence for the previously published README saturation excerpt. Its
retained point reports establish the configuration and values, but do not identify the tested Git
revision; the nearby N3 corpus revision must not be assumed to apply to NS.

## No-speculation context profile

MTP0 uses the [single-request method](methodology.md#single-request-phases), five samples per context.

### groupwise-int

Run [G0](#g0).

## Single-request speculative decode

These are per-request phase statistics from the C=1 points of the [corpus runs](#corpus-makespan),
not separate experiments. Each reasoning fixture has five seeds; each category pools three
fixtures × five seeds. Values are mean ± sample standard deviation of per-request rates and ratios.
The prompt set, seeds, sampling, and output budgets match across weights and speculative modes;
continuations can differ. AIME 15 reaches 65,536 tokens in all G3 samples and averages 65,414.4
in N3. DFlash2 termination and repetition outcomes follow the tables.

### DFlash2 completion outcomes

Runs [ND](#nd) and [GD](#gd).

Entries are stop-token / output-limit counts. A stop token denotes termination, not task
correctness; this campaign does not assign answer-accuracy or prompt-compliance scores.

| Workload | Samples per profile | NVFP4 stop / limit | Groupwise-int stop / limit |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `long_decode_aime26_01` | 5 | 5 / 0 | 5 / 0 |
| `long_decode_aime26_15` | 5 | 0 / 5 | 0 / 5 |
| `long_decode_aime26_30` | 5 | 5 / 0 | 4 / 1 |
| Code | 15 | 5 / 10 | 1 / 14 |
| Story | 15 | 10 / 5 | 10 / 5 |
| Translation | 15 | 15 / 0 | 15 / 0 |
| Structured | 15 | 0 / 15 | 1 / 14 |
| **Total** | **75** | **40 / 35** | **36 / 39** |

All ten AIME 15 samples exhaust the 65,536-token output budget. Their rates characterize sustained
long decode rather than completed reasoning. Code, story, and structured-output rates likewise
include the output-limit samples counted above.

The groupwise-int AIME 30 sample with seed `9060622443728853932` repeats `-?` 32,046 times in its
reasoning field, has empty final content, and reaches 65,536 completion tokens. Its 96.8% acceptance
and 302.6 tok/s describe a repetition loop. It remains in the five-sample mean of 175.2 ± 71.5 tok/s;
the other four samples stop naturally and average 143.3 ± 6.3 tok/s. This four-sample statistic is
supplementary and does not replace the fixed-corpus result.

## Corpus makespan

The [fixed-corpus method](methodology.md#corpus-makespan) uses 75 requests per point and shuffle
seed `20260811`. Each row is one complete run. Corpus rates use the full makespan; acceptance is
the ratio of summed accepted and drafted tokens. Average batch covers transitions and drain.
C=1 supplies the phase statistics above.

### MTP3 groupwise-int

Run [G3](#g3).

| C | Requests | Computed prefill tokens | Decode tokens | Makespan (s) | Requests/s | Corpus prefill (tok/s) | Corpus decode (tok/s) | Avg batch | MTP acceptance | Speedup vs. C1 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 75 | 15,460 | 747,295 | 4,622.59 | 0.0162 | 3.3 | 161.7 | 1.00 | 58.5% | 1.00× |
| 2 | 75 | 15,460 | 766,184 | 3,580.22 | 0.0209 | 4.3 | 214.0 | 1.91 | 59.5% | 1.29× |
| 4 | 75 | 15,460 | 739,692 | 2,864.48 | 0.0262 | 5.4 | 258.2 | 3.67 | 58.3% | 1.61× |
| 8 | 75 | 15,460 | 697,193 | 2,211.20 | 0.0339 | 7.0 | 315.3 | 4.76 | 58.9% | 2.09× |

All 300 requests completed without a request, CUDA, or out-of-memory failure. C=8 gives the
shortest complete-corpus makespan. `--kv-capacity auto` resolved to 131,072, 262,144, 341,952, and
313,984 tokens at C=1, 2, 4, and 8. C=8 reached a maximum of four waiting requests while admitting
long contexts into the shared pool; no spill, owner degradation/eviction, or search-exhaustion
event occurred.

### MTP3 nvfp4

Run [N3](#n3).

| C | Requests | Computed prefill tokens | Decode tokens | Makespan (s) | Requests/s | Corpus prefill (tok/s) | Corpus decode (tok/s) | Avg batch | MTP acceptance | Speedup vs. C1 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 75 | 15,460 | 752,160 | 4,670.27 | 0.0161 | 3.3 | 161.1 | 1.00 | 60.8% | 1.00× |
| 2 | 75 | 15,460 | 739,951 | 2,510.78 | 0.0299 | 6.2 | 294.7 | 1.98 | 59.2% | 1.86× |
| 4 | 75 | 15,460 | 713,384 | 1,647.74 | 0.0455 | 9.4 | 432.9 | 3.29 | 58.0% | 2.83× |
| 8 | 75 | 15,460 | 723,602 | 2,164.90 | 0.0346 | 7.1 | 334.2 | 2.36 | 57.6% | 2.16× |

All 300 requests completed without a request, CUDA, or out-of-memory failure. C=4 gives the
shortest complete-corpus makespan. C=8 is limited by memory pressure, which constrains effective
batching and makes the end-to-end result slower than C=4.

The groupwise-int weight arena is 16.672 GiB versus 19.729 GiB for NVFP4. At C=8, the smaller
resident profile permits 313,984 tokens of Device KV versus 187,712 and raises the full-corpus
average batch from 2.36 to 4.76. The best measured point is therefore C=8 for groupwise-int and C=4
for NVFP4.

N3 automatic KV capacity at C=1, 2, 4, 8 resolved to 131,072, 255,360, 232,768, and 187,712
tokens respectively.

### DFlash2 K=7

Runs [ND](#nd), then [GD](#gd), on 2026-09-06 after the terminal-settlement fix. Each computed
15,460 prefill tokens with average decode batch 1.00 and automatic KV capacity 131,072 tokens.

| Weights ID | Requests | Completion tokens | Decode tokens | Makespan (s) | Requests/s | Corpus decode (tok/s) | DFlash2 acceptance |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `nvfp4` | 75 | 695,432 | 695,357 | 3,611.52 | 0.0208 | 192.5 | 37.0% |
| `groupwise-int` | 75 | 761,763 | 761,688 | 5,181.45 | 0.0145 | 147.0 | 39.2% |

All 150 requests completed without request errors. The earlier interrupted NVFP4 run is excluded;
these are the two complete post-fix runs. [Completion outcomes](#dflash2-completion-outcomes)
include natural stops, output limits, and the groupwise-int repetition outlier.

## Decode saturation

Run [NS](#ns), NVFP4 MTP3, uses the [sustained-wave method](methodology.md#decode-saturation).
The rendered prompt is 335 tokens per request, compared with 293 for the published Qwen3.6
profiles. Each request has an 8,192-token output budget; each C point is one wave.

| C | Steady (s) | Avg batch | Steady decode (tok/s) | MTP acceptance (wave) | Speedup vs. C1 | Wave makespan (s) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 55.15 | 1.00 | 143.8 | 48.9% | 1.00× | 56.95 |
| 2 | 60.04 | 2.00 | 267.6 | 48.1% | 1.86× | 61.29 |
| 4 | 68.17 | 4.00 | 461.1 | 45.8% | 3.21× | 72.14 |
| 8 | 81.09 | 8.00 | 766.6 | 46.0% | 5.33× | 87.29 |

All 15 recorded requests reached the output limit, producing 122,880 completion tokens. There
are 264 selected steady intervals. This is sustained decode, without an answer/structure audit.
The retained point reports do not identify the tested Git revision.

## Comparisons and limitations

### DFlash2 phase rates versus historical MTP3

ND versus N3 and GD versus G3 at C=1. These historical percentages use the displayed rounded
means; future comparisons follow the unrounded-report rule in the methodology.

Changes below compare the displayed per-request mean decode rates in the tables above. G3/N3 use
their separately listed revisions and earlier artifacts; prompts, seeds, output budgets, and shared
sampling/context settings match. Stochastic output lengths differ, and these percentages do not
isolate the backend's effect on identical generated tokens.

| Workload | NVFP4 DFlash2 change | Groupwise-int DFlash2 change |
|---|---:|---:|
| `long_decode_aime26_01` | +64.5% | +15.9% |
| `long_decode_aime26_15` | +21.1% | -11.1% |
| `long_decode_aime26_30` | +19.2% | +2.4% |
| Code | +36.6% | -4.4% |
| Story | -3.8% | -35.6% |
| Translation | +33.1% | -8.2% |
| Structured | +62.3% | +19.1% |

The groupwise-int AIME 30 change includes the [repetition outlier](#dflash2-completion-outcomes) and does not establish a
reasoning-performance improvement.

### DFlash2 corpus versus historical MTP3

ND versus N3 and GD versus G3, using complete-corpus metrics at C=1.
Against the historical C=1 MTP3 corpus, NVFP4's full-makespan decode rate rises 19.5% and makespan
falls 22.7%; groupwise-int's rate falls 9.1% and makespan rises 12.1%. These compare the recorded
campaigns, not an isolated backend change: revisions differ, and the stochastic backends produce
different continuations and token totals. No fresh MTP3 baseline was run.

MTP0 and speculative scenarios measure different workloads. No per-scenario baseline/speculative
speedup is reported. Neither the phase-rate nor makespan comparisons establish answer accuracy.

## Vision residency on RTX 3090 (`groupwise-int`, sm_86)

Measured by this fork, not upstream — see the [hardware label](../performance.md#rtx-3090-sm_86-findings-this-fork).

Dedicated RunPod RTX 3090 (24 GiB, driver 580.159, CUDA 13.1 build, nothing else on the GPU).
Server flags common to every row: `--kv-capacity auto --max-concurrency 1 --prefill-chunk 1024
--spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 --lm-head-draft`; the vision rows add `--vision --vision-max-merged
12288` with `--vision-residency resident` or `overlay`. Maximum `--max-context` that boots,
bisected to 8192 tokens:

| `--kv-dtype` | no `--vision` (auto / explicit) | resident Vision (auto / explicit) | overlay Vision (auto / explicit) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `int8` | 147 456 / 180 224 | 122 880 / 159 744 | **147 456 / 180 224** |
| `rk8v4` | 196 608 / 237 568 | 163 840 / 210 944 | **196 608 / 237 568** |
| `bf16` | 73 728 / 92 160 | 65 536 / 81 920 | **73 728 / 92 160** |

`auto` is `--kv-capacity auto` (keeps 1 GiB of automatic headroom); `explicit` is the largest `--kv-capacity N --max-context N` that boots, bisected to 2048 tokens, with a 1920×1080 image request completing at the overlay maximum.

Overlay boots the no-vision capacity in every storage mode: the resident Vision cost
(24 576 / 32 768 / 8 192 tokens) is gone. `free-after-weights` rises by 0.26 GiB (the tower is
host-pinned) and the startup runtime reservation drops from 2.66 GiB to 2.23 GiB at 65 536 tokens.

Greedy completions of a 1920×1080 gradient image (2074 merged tokens), of a 4000×3000 image
downscaled by the budget to 11 767 merged tokens, and of their follow-up turns are byte-identical
between residencies (`tools/smoke/overlay_ab.py`). The follow-up turn reuses the prefix and opens
no window. At `--max-concurrency 2` two text requests complete alongside the image request.

Text throughput without images is unchanged between residencies (7.7k-token prefill / 320-token
decode, three runs each in one boot order): `int8` 852–862 vs 846–852 tok/s prefill and 53–62 vs
55–60 tok/s decode, `rk8v4` 845–870 vs 857–875 tok/s prefill and 55–57 vs 57–58 tok/s decode.

Per-image cost of a window (rk8v4, `--max-concurrency 1`): the 1920×1080 image reaches its first
token in 3.55 s under overlay against 3.47 s resident (window 477 ms: 192 MiB evicted in 4 ms,
restored in 11 ms, 282 MiB of tower streamed behind compute); the 4000×3000 image reaches it in
22.8 s against 23.0 s (window 6.65 s, 784 MiB evicted in 10 ms, restored in 49 ms). Boot-to-boot
prefill throughput on the rented card varies by about ±15 % (GPU clocks), so residencies are only
compared within one run.

### Where a window borrows its memory

An overlay window is funded from free KV pages when they cover it, and from the evict-ranked
weight tail otherwise. The request log names the tier: `overlay=1xconc` for the KV-funded window,
which leaves the text weights mapped so other lanes keep decoding, and `overlay=1xexcl` for the
weight-tail window, which stops every lane until it closes.

`tools/smoke/vision_stall_probe.py` streams one text completion and sends a 1920×1080 image
request while it runs (`--max-concurrency 2`, `--prefill-chunk 256`, rk8v4). Inter-token gaps of
the text stream:

| window | KV capacity | gap p50 | gap p99 | gap max | window |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `conc` (free KV pages) | 65 536 | 40 ms | 340 ms | 413 ms | 408 ms |
| `excl` (weight tail) | 20 480 | 40 ms | 670 ms | 670 ms | 356 ms |

The exclusive window adds its whole duration to the worst gap; the concurrent one does not, and
what remains is the image prompt's own prefill chunks, which block decode in either case. A KV
cache smaller than one window (the 20 480-token row) simply has no pages to lend, so every window
there is exclusive and the engine behaves exactly as it did before this tier existed.

The remapping itself is cheap on both paths: 192 MiB left the arena in 3.9–31 ms and came back in
12–32 ms. The KV path pays more of it because it remaps 2 MiB granules where the weight path
remaps 16 MiB chunks.
