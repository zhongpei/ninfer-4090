# NInfer-3090 for Linux — release archive

This is the README that ships **inside** the Linux release archive, where every file sits in one
directory. If you are reading it in a checkout instead, the launchers and downloaders it names live
under `scripts/`, and
[docs/rtx-3090-linux.md](https://github.com/ashalliants/ninfer-3090/blob/master/docs/rtx-3090-linux.md)
is the guide to building from source. Links here are absolute on purpose: the archive ships no
`docs/` directory.

Check `VERSION` for the release this archive was cut from, and `RELEASE_NOTES_*.md` for what
changed.

## Requirements

- x86-64 Linux with glibc 2.38 or newer (the binaries are built on Ubuntu 24.04)
- GeForce RTX 3090 (or 3090 Ti) with a recent NVIDIA driver
- The CUDA 12.8 runtime libraries, **including cuBLAS** (`libcudart.so.12`, `libcublas.so.12`,
  `libcublasLt.so.12`). The cuBLAS prefill route links it, so the binaries need it even when you do
  not turn that route on. From NVIDIA's CUDA repository: `sudo apt install cuda-libraries-12-8`
- FFmpeg 6 shared libraries and libcurl (`sudo apt install ffmpeg libcurl4t64` on Ubuntu 24.04)
- `curl` for the downloaders

Model artifacts are **not** included — they are 17–21 GB each. The downloaders below fetch them.

## Quick start

From the directory you unpacked, two commands:

```bash
./download-model.sh qwen36-35b-a3b     # ~21 GB, resumable, verifies size and SHA256
./run.sh qwen36-35b-a3b                # serves on http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1
```

The downloader writes into `models/` beside these files, which is where the launcher looks. Set
`NINFER_MODEL_DIR` to keep artifacts elsewhere, or `NINFER_MODEL` to point the launcher at a single
file.

That is the headless profile: two lanes, `rk8v4` KV, MTP3 speculation plus the draft head, and
vision in overlay residency, with `NINFER_CONTEXT` defaulting to 262,144.

Do not assume that context holds. Speculation is not free context — the MTP head is 856 MiB and the
draft head another 136 MiB, roughly 130,000 rk8v4 tokens of KV — so `NINFER_SPEC=none` is what
actually reaches the native 262,144 maximum, at about 183 tok/s instead of 240–280. Drop a rung
(196608 / 131072 / 114688 / 98304 / 81920) if startup refuses. For the dense 27B instead:

```bash
./download-model.sh qwen38-27b         # ~19 GB, the DFlash2 bundle; it also carries the MTP weights
./run.sh qwen38-27b                    # one lane, 131,072 tokens, DFlash2 (fastest)
```

For the longest context instead, `NINFER_SPEC=mtp ./run.sh qwen38-27b` runs the MTP profile at two
lanes and 212,992 tokens each with a smaller prefill chunk and `--lm-head-q6`: slower decode, more
context.

`./run.sh qwen38-27b int8` and `./run.sh qwen38-27b c8` are the older INT8 profiles — one user at
65,536 tokens, and eight concurrent users at 8,192 each.

The endpoint is OpenAI-compatible, so anything that speaks `/v1/chat/completions` works. Leave the
API key blank.

## What is in the archive

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `ninfer-serve` | the server: OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible HTTP APIs |
| `ninfer` | one-shot CLI generation, for smoke tests and scripting |
| `ninfer_bench` | throughput benchmark against the public Engine route |
| `download-model.sh` | pinned, resumable artifact downloads with verification |
| `run.sh` | serving profiles: `run.sh <model> [profile]` |
| `SHA256SUMS.txt` | checksums for every file in this directory |

## Overrides

Nothing here needs editing. `NINFER_SERVER`, `NINFER_MODEL_DIR`, `NINFER_MODEL`, `NINFER_HOST` and
`NINFER_PORT` work for every profile.

| profile | also reads |
|---|---|
| `run.sh <model>` (`tuned`) | `NINFER_CONTEXT`, `NINFER_CONCURRENCY`, `NINFER_KV_CAPACITY`, `NINFER_KV_DTYPE`, `NINFER_SPEC` (27B: `dflash2`, `mtp`, `none`; 35B: `mtp`, `none`), `NINFER_VISION`, `NINFER_VISION_RESIDENCY`, `NINFER_DRAFT_TOKENS`, `NINFER_PREFILL_CHUNK`, `NINFER_HOST_STATE_SLOTS`, `NINFER_FALLBACK` (`off` turns the automatic step-down off) |
| `run.sh qwen38-27b int8`, `run.sh qwen38-27b c8` | nothing further; every serving flag is fixed |
| `download-model.sh <model>` | `NINFER_MODEL_DIR`, `NINFER_SKIP_SHA256` |

> `NINFER_HOST=0.0.0.0` exposes the server to your network **unauthenticated**. The launchers bind
> `127.0.0.1` for that reason. If you set it, put something in front of it.

## If startup refuses

**The default profile handles this for you.** If `run.sh` is refused at startup for lack of GPU
memory (a desktop, or another job, is holding VRAM), it steps down by itself -- an eighth of the
context at a time, up to five times, with a 2048 prefill chunk and fewer host state slots -- says what
it did, and starts. It only does this for the defaults: a `NINFER_CONTEXT`, `NINFER_PREFILL_CHUNK`,
`NINFER_HOST_STATE_SLOTS` or `NINFER_KV_CAPACITY` you set is honoured as given, and
`NINFER_FALLBACK=off` turns it off.

For those cases the message names the numbers. Drop a context rung first —
`NINFER_CONTEXT=196608`, then 131072, 114688, 98304, 81920 (the default DFlash2 profile starts at
131072, so begin at 114688 there). Speculation is the next lever
(`NINFER_SPEC=none`), worth about 992 MiB at the cost of decode speed. Drop vision last: in overlay
residency it costs almost nothing resident, and an `evictable pool window exceeds the evictable
tail` message means the reservation is already tight rather than that the context is too large.

`--host-kv-mib 8192` behaves differently here than on Windows: on Linux it really does pin 8 GiB of
host RAM. On Windows/WDDM a pinned host allocation is charged against the card, so the runtime
clamps it hard. Same flag, different platform behaviour, by design.
